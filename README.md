# minigame-Bouncing-ball-
This minigame just for little bit fun and testing my skills in libraries

# Description:

For this game used this libraries : tkinter , random , time

gameplay very easy, you have ball that jumps every time when you hit that your paddle, in this game dont have mechanics that counts your score or mechanics that can restart game.

So you need to relaunch that game, for play if u loose, but you must clear your terminal for that

# How to play:

 i know, this looks strange for that game but just for info for all, movement just 3 buttons, to the left and right, use just normal arrows, like left and right, and we have 1 button from mouse or touchpad, for start game, just click 1 left button on mouse.

### Left arrow: turns to the left

### Right arrow: turns to the right

### Left mouse button: starting the game
